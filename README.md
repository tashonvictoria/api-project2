# api-project2

I created a REST API highlighting some of the top "instagramable", trendy, popular restaurants around the world. This api is fully CRUD functioning. 

Although this API is working it is not yet fully completed. This is just the start to a database that I havent yet to come accross anywhere. I would like to add so much more vital information to this database like photos, videos, aesethics, as well as more restaurants, locations to all of the chain restaurants.
